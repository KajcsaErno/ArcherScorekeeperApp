# Score Keeper App
The goal is to create a Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of my choice.

## What I learned? ##
This project is about combining various ideas and skills Iâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

* Adding button code to your app
* Updating views
* Properly scoping variables
* Finding views by their ID

## Final result of my project - Archer Scorekeeper App
